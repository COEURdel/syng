## __About__
Syng is a free, open source, Chinese-To-English and English-To-Chinese Dictionary app that makes it easy to lookup words and phrases quickly. This service will be made for desktop operating systems, and there are no plans to build something for mobile platforms. _For a good mobile platform alternative the app [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) is an excellent option._
